* Send Bits to Controller
* Can I set the INS from 1 Device in a chain? (NO)
  * Likely, but re-executing an INS to keep a dev's DR selected while charging another DR may have side effects.
  * INS may reset a DR, appears to be chip specific: DANGER
  * Looks like a bad idea!
* INS None should resolve to bypass
* Write IIR should resp;ve dpwn to state change and data write. If state is the same, state change is removed.
* TDI is D/C during non shift states
* Layer 3 is unavailable until scan chain initialization
* Each layer needs to be optimized one at a time. Allows layer specific rules, and checking.
